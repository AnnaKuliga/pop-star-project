            <h3>Calum Scott</h3>
            <p>
              Calum Scott (born 12 October 1988) is an English singer and
              songwriter. In April 2015, he rose to prominence after competing
              on the ITV talent contest Britain's Got Talent, where he performed
              his version of Robyn's hit "Dancing on My Own". After coming sixth
              in the contest, he released his version as a single the following
              year, which peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart and
              became Britain's best-selling single of summer 2016. <br />Scott
              later signed with Capitol and in 2017, released the single "You
              Are the Reason", which was included on his 2018 debut album Only
              Human, which reached number 4 on the UK Albums Chart. Later in
              2018, he collaborated with Leona Lewis to release a duet version
              of the single "You Are the Reason".

            <h3>2013–2015: Career beginning and Britain's Got Talent</h3>
            <p>
              On 11 April 2015, Scott's audition for the ninth series of
              Britain's Got Talent was broadcast on ITV. Just before his
              audition, his sister Jade also auditioned but was stopped early on
              both of her songs by Simon Cowell. Jade received four "No" votes
              from David Walliams, Alesha Dixon, Amanda Holden and Simon Cowell.
              Despite obvious nerves at seeing his sister get rejected, Calum
              performed a cover of Robyn's "Dancing on My Own", which he had
              heard Kings of Leon performing on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge in
              2013. Following a standing ovation from the judging panel, Cowell
              pressed the Golden Buzzer giving Scott an automatic place in the
              live shows. Explaining his decision to send Scott straight to the
              semi-finals, Cowell said:<br />

              "I've never ever in all the years I've done this show heard a guy
              with the talent you've got. Seriously. And the version was
              sensational, and that shows to me that actually, you're more than
              a singer, you're an artist, and that's why you got that (the
              buzzer)."
